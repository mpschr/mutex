The MutEx algorithm is described in detail in the PhD Thesis "Analysis and visualization of multidimensional cancer genomics data" : http://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/301436. The same algorithm is also implemented and directly usable in the Gitools software package: http://www.gitools.org

The algorithm itself has first been used in the following publication:
